Mach 1:
- given an image,
- returns array with pico8 colors
	- tests:
		- 128x128 with all colors (all vertical lines)
		- transparent pixels
		- throw an error if a color does not belong to pico8 palette
		- throw an error if png file is empty

Mach 2:
- given an image
- returns lua code as a string ie:
	- pico8 colors, separated by commas
	- loop to draw the string

MVP:
- given a 128x128 png
- returns p8 code that will draw that png when placed inside the draw function
- image is alays drawn from 0,0

Edge cases:
- black for now is treated as a non-transparent color (because it is set using pset. If it was drawn via spr, it would be treated as transparent)
